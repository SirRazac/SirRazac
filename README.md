👋 **Welcome to my GitHub profile!**

I am SirRazac, a newcomer to the tech industry and a passionate learner on my journey to becoming an enthusiastic developer. I’m exploring various technologies, working on projects, and constantly expanding my knowledge to solve real-world problems.

📈 **My Focus Areas**

- **Full-Stack Web Development**: Building interactive and high-performance frontends with React, as well as developing robust backends and databases for a complete application experience.
- **IoT Development**: From hardware to the cloud, exploring the integration of IoT devices with cloud platforms.

📁 **My Projects**

🌡️ **Hygrometer and Thermometer System**

**Description**:  
A comprehensive IoT project that measures humidity and temperature, sending push notifications to mobile devices when thresholds are exceeded.

**Tech Stack**: Raspberry Pi, Python, Firebase, React, ngrok, React Native.

**Features**:  
- **Hardware**: Humidity and temperature sensors on the Raspberry Pi.  
- **Backend**: Python scripts for data collection and communication with Firebase.  
- **Frontend**:
   - A React app to test the API integration and generate device tokens for push notifications.
   - A React Native app that serves as the user interface for the hygrometer system.
- **Push Notifications**: Real-time alerts directly to the mobile device.

## 🔄 **Python Scripts Collection**

**Description**:  
A collection of Python scripts that focus on practical tools and utilities. These scripts help in solving everyday tasks and practicing programming concepts, with a focus on improving skills in Python.

**Tech Stack**: Python.
