## 👋 **Welcome to my GitHub profile!**

I am SirRazac, a newcomer to the tech industry and a passionate learner on my journey to becoming an enthusiastic developer. I’m exploring various technologies, working on projects, and constantly expanding my knowledge to solve real-world problems.

#### 📈 **My Focus Areas**

- **Full-Stack Web Development**: Building interactive and high-performance frontends with React, as well as developing robust backends and databases for a complete application experience.
- **IoT Development**: From hardware to the cloud, exploring the integration of IoT devices with cloud platforms.

### 📁 **My Projects**

#### 🌡️ **[Hygrometer and Thermometer System](#)**

**Description**:  
A comprehensive IoT project that measures humidity and temperature, sending push notifications to mobile devices when thresholds are exceeded.

**Tech Stack**: Raspberry Pi, Python, Firebase, React, ngrok, React Native.

**Features**:  
- **Hardware**: Humidity and temperature sensors on the Raspberry Pi.  
- **Backend**: Python scripts for data collection and communication with Firebase.  
- **Frontend**:
   - A React app to test the API integration and generate device tokens for push notifications.
   - A React Native app that serves as the user interface for the hygrometer system.
- **Push Notifications**: Real-time alerts directly to the mobile device.

#### 🔄 **[Python Scripts Collection](#)**

**Description**:  
A collection of Python scripts that focus on practical tools and utilities. These scripts help in solving everyday tasks and practicing programming concepts, with a focus on improving skills in Python.

**Tech Stack**: Python.

**Features**:  
- **Timers and Time Calculators**: Scripts that measure elapsed time or calculate durations between given time points.
- **Push Notification Sender**: A script that sends push notifications to a smartphone, offering practical experience with real-time messaging systems.
- **Basic Python Utilities**: Other small projects that help improve understanding of Python’s basic features and libraries.

**Goal**:  
The collection is intended to grow with more scripts focused on data structures, algorithms, and other Python programming concepts. As I continue to explore Python, this repository will evolve to include more complex projects, contributing to the deepening of my knowledge.

#### 🌐 **[React Frontend Applications](#)**

**Description**:  
A collection of projects built with React to learn and deepen various frontend concepts. These applications also support the hygrometer project and provide a practical way to experiment with React while building useful tools.

**Tech Stack**: React, Firebase, ngrok.

**Features**:  
- **Weather App**: Dynamic display of weather data, learning how to integrate APIs and display live data.  
- **QR Code Generator**: Simple creation of QR codes, a practical tool for learning React's dynamic rendering and input handling.  
- **Recipe Generator**: Provides inspiration for new cooking ideas, demonstrating form handling and data management in React.  
- **Firebase Integration**: Device token generation for push notifications, helping to explore backend communication and real-time data updates.  
- **Additional Projects**: There are already several other projects included that help explore and internalize key frontend and full-stack concepts, contributing to a deeper understanding and practical application of React.

**Goal**:  
The collection is designed to help learn and internalize key frontend development concepts. It will continue to grow with new projects focused on React, state management, and full-stack development. As I dive deeper into advanced React features and back-end integration, this repository will expand to include more complex projects, contributing to my growth as a full-stack developer.
