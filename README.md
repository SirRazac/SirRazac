🌡️ **Hygrometer and Thermometer System**

Description:  
A comprehensive IoT project that measures humidity and temperature, sending push notifications to mobile devices when thresholds are exceeded.

Tech Stack: Raspberry Pi, Python, Firebase, React, ngrok, React Native.

Features:  
- **Hardware**: Humidity and temperature sensors on the Raspberry Pi.  
- **Backend**: Python scripts for data collection and communication with Firebase.  
- **Frontend**:
   - A React app to test the API integration and generate device tokens for push notifications.
   - A React Native app that serves as the user interface for the hygrometer system.
- **Push Notifications**: Real-time alerts directly to the mobile device.

🔄 **Algorithm Collection**

Description:  
A collection of Python scripts that implement basic data structures and algorithms. Ideal for understanding and practicing concepts.

Tech Stack: Python.

Features:  
- Implementation of sorting and searching algorithms.  
- Demonstrations of basic data structures like Linked Lists and Stacks.

🌐 **React Frontend Applications**

Description:  
A collection of projects built with React to learn and deepen various frontend concepts. These applications also support the hygrometer project.

Tech Stack: React, Firebase, ngrok.
